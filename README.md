# ü´Ä Group Counterfactual Explanations for Heart Disease Risk Reduction

## Overview

This repository contains the complete implementation of **Group Counterfactual Explanations (GroupCE)** applied to heart disease risk reduction, representing the first application of GroupCE methodology to healthcare data. The research demonstrates how mathematical optimization can generate clinically feasible intervention prototypes that reclassify high-risk cardiac patients to low-risk status.

### Research Question
*"How can Group Counterfactual Explanations (GroupCE) be applied to identify actionable health interventions that would reclassify high-risk cardiac patients to low-risk status?"*

### Key Achievements
- **3 clinical prototypes** 
- **Demographic-specific interventions**
- **High-risk patients** identified for targeted intervention
- **First healthcare application** of GroupCE methodology
